You'll need sphinx installed on the box of course:
http://sphinxsearch.com/downloads.html

This app relies on scraping data from Workingwithrails.com and using the ruby-github gem that wraps the github api.
The search and thus the whole app depends on thinkingsphinx running
rake ts:stop
rake ts:index
rake ts:start  -- bare minimum to get it running and have search work.

To load data via the scraper:

--scrape every coder using the browse by letter pages on WWR, A to Z
rake wwr:remote:load_all  

--scrape based on randomly selected seed data and the top 100 on WWR
rake wwr:remote:load

--scrape just one letter page
rake wwr:remote:load_by_letter letter=A
